# My 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Description

This is a repo that will hold all links to code and journals I
write as a part of my 100 Days Of Code challenge. See Journals folder and find the a desired date's markdown file for a specific date's journal entry.

## Purpose

My purpose for commiting to the 100 Days Of Code challenge is to build the practice of consistently writing well written code. I am also looking to improve my web design skills as well as my technical writing. I am hoping to share my thoughts on all the projects I work on during this challenge here in this repo. My hope is that I can provide my insights into the coding thought process so that coding new comers (or anyone for that matter) can learn how to think in a coding mindset.

## My Rules

1. I must code for a minimum of 1 hour every week day for a total of 100 days.

2. I must tweet my progress using #100DaysOfCode.

3. I don't have to code on weekends.

4. I must write a minimum of 5 sentences for a daily journal reflection explaining my progress which will be posted everyday on this GitHub repo.

5. All code that qualifies for this challenge must be made public that day and be held to good coding standards to the best of my ability.

## Aditional Information

1. All links to code I worked on during a specific day can be found within that specific day's file here in this repo.

2. The reason why I have decided to not code on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) is because I am a big proponent on taking breaks. My goal with this challenge is not really to make a habit of coding, but rather to make a habit out of writing consistent quality code that I am proud to share with others. For me personally, taking short breaks from coding helps me write better code when I return to write more.

3. I also want to use this challenge as a way for me to improve my ability to communicate my thought process and code to others, as well as my ability to design and implement code. This is why I have also committed to writing more lengthy daily coding reflections rather than just one short tweet.
