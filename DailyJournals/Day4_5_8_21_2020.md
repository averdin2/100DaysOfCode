Day 4:

All I did was create a form input for inputting the API game data link. Like I mentioned in my previous 100 Days of Code journal, I was not able to dynamically generate the API game data links needed to provide data on a day to day basis. In order to do so, I would have to hard code links for the rest of the season which I don’t feel like doing. Also, this way the project can be a more long-term thing since it can work as long as you can provide the API link. I know, this basically makes the usefulness of the project pointless, but it was a good learning experience for me.

From this project I learned that I really didn’t need to use Redux, but it was a good project to learn the basics. I also learned to play around with APIs a bit more before diving deep into making the project. If I had known it would have been impossible to use this API the way I intended, I probably would have chosen another project or tweaked my project a bit. Either way, I enjoyed working on this project and I am happy to finally be finished working on it.

Day 5:

Not much to say really; This is why I combined the two days for one journal entry. Mainly just focused on learning more about testing JavaScript and React with Jest. Not all that much coding.
