## Journal

I spent most of today fixing errors that I had on older projects. I originally started out wanting to update the ReadMe for my Dodgers Scoreboard project, but realized that when I updated node a few days ago, that I needed to update some project dependencies. After updating the project dependencies, I made my changes. I also decided that I would have a default game link in my Dodgers app so I did that as well and moved on.

I knew that I wanted to update my About Me section for my personal website and add my React Pomodoro Project. I also needed to update some dependencies there. I then made the changes and was done.

Finally, I knew that my covid-19 project had run into CORS errors while deployed which was bad. Somehow, I have yet to run into CORS errors on my other projects so I needed to see how to fix it. The solution I ended up going with was adding a link to a proxy server that would add the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the request response. This remedies the CORS error. While implementing this fix, I also found that one of the APIs I was using for the project had changed routes. I then had to go through the documentation and fix my code to update it based on the API changes. I got the site working and was able to upload it.

I have linked the sources I used to update my projects above if you are curious about any of these topics.
